# Terms and Conditions & Privacy Policy for Health Assistant

**Last Updated: December 14, 2025**

## 1. Introduction
Welcome to Health Assistant ("the App"). By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use the App.

## 2. Nature of the App (Client-Side Only)
The App is a standalone, client-side utility designed to help you aggregate and view your personal health information.
*   **Local Storage**: All health data retrieved from third-party providers (such as MyChart/Epic) is stored **locally on your device**. We do not operate a cloud server to store, analyze, or sell your health data.
*   **No Intermediary**: When you connect to a healthcare provider, the connection is direct between your device and the provider. We do not act as a "middleman" server tailored to intercept your credentials or records.

## 3. Integration with Third-Party Providers
The App allows you to connect with third-party healthcare providers via APIs (e.g., Epic Systems Corporation's MyChart).
*   **Authentication**: You authenticate directly with these providers. The App does not see or store your permanent login passwords; it utilizes secure tokens provided by the OAuth 2.0 protocol.
*   **Disclaimer**: We are not affiliated with, endorsed by, or responsible for the medical records systems of Epic Systems Corporation or any specific healthcare organization (e.g., Sutter Health, UMass Memorial). Your use of their services is subject to their respective terms and privacy policies.

## 4. User-Configured AI Tools
The App may offer features allowing you to process your local health data using generic AI tools or cloud-based Large Language Models (LLMs).
*   **User Choice**: Using these features is entirely optional and initiated solely by you.
*   **Data Transmission**: If you choose to use a cloud-based AI service, you acknowledge that portions of your data may be transmitted to that third-party provider (e.g., OpenAI, Google, Anthropic) for processing.
*   **Liability Waiver**: By configuring and using these AI tools, you explicitly trust that third-party service with your data. **The developers of Health Assistant are not responsible for how strictly your chosen AI provider handles, trains on, or secures the data you voluntarily send to them.** We are merely the interface; you are the controller of that data flow.

## 5. User Responsibilities
*   **Security**: Since data is stored on your device, you are responsible for maintaining the security of your physical device (e.g., using a passcode, FaceID, or TouchID).
*   **Medical Advice**: The App is a tool for organization and reference only. **It does not provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.** Always seek the advice of your physician or other qualified health provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition.

## 6. Privacy Policy
Your privacy is paramount. Because this App is client-side only, our policy is simple:
*   **Data Collection**: We (the App developers) do not collect, transmit, or store your personal health data on our servers. It stays on your device.
*   **Third-Parties**: Data is only shared with third parties (like Epic or an AI provider) when you explicitly perform an action to connect or send it.
*   **Analytics**: We may collect anonymous, non-identifiable usage data (e.g., "app crashed") solely to improve app stability, but this never includes PHI (Protected Health Information).

## 7. Limitation of Liability
To the fullest extent permitted by law, the developers of Health Assistant shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of data, arising out of or in connection with your use of the App.

## 8. Changes to Terms
We reserve the right to modify these terms at any time. Your continued use of the App following any changes indicates your acceptance of the new terms.
